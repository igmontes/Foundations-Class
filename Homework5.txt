1. Which of the followings is considered boxing?
	a. double dblx = fx;
	b. float fx = ix;
	c. object myobjx = fx;
	d. int ix = objy;

Answer: C


2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing?
	a. string str = ix.ToString();
	b. double dblx =(double) fx;
	c. object myobjx = fx;
	d. int ix = (int) objy;

Answer: D


3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.
	float fx = objdblx;

Answer: float fx = (float)objdblx;


4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.
	double dx = objflx;

Answer double dx = (double)(float)objflx;


5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:
	double dblx =

Answer: double dblx = double.parse(strx);


6. Convert the integer ix to a float fx:
	float fx =

Answer: float fx = (float)ix;


7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:
	string strx =

Answer: string strx = Convert.ToString(dblx);


8. Object is the  "BASE"  class of all other data types.


9. What is an object (the definition)?
Answer: 
	In Object Oriented Programming it is a structure
	for incorporating data and the procedures to work
	with that data.

	In C# programming it is an actual "type" of container
	and data can be assigned to it.


10. How do you declare an object in C#?
Answer: object myobject;


11. What is the difference between an object and a variable?
Answer: A variable has more functions associated with it than
	an object, the number of fucntions varies per variable
	type.

	An object only has 4 functions associated with it and
	in order to assign or retrieve data from it, you have
	to use the "boxing" or "unboxing" methods, respectively.
